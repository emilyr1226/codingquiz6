plusMinus:
The time complexity of plusMinus is O(n). This because we are first initializing three variables, which is constant. Then, we have a for each loop traversing through our input array, which is linear. Within the for-each loop, we have constant work. Outside of the loop, we have constant work in which we are changing variable and printing the variables out. Thus, the time complexity is linear. 
The space complexity of plusMinus is O(1). This because we are not using more memory than our input list. Thus, the space complexity is constant.
