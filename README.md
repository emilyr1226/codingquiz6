plusMinus:
The time complexity of plusMinus is O(n). This is because we are first initializing three variables, which are constant. Then, we have a for-each loop traversing through our input list, which is linear. Within the for-each loop, we have constant work. Outside of the loop, we have constant work in which we are changing the variable and printing the variables out. Thus, the time complexity is linear. 
The space complexity of plusMinus is O(1). This is because we are not using more memory than our input list. Thus, the space complexity is constant.
